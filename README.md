Spotify Clone

This is my Spotify Clone project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As a beginner in web development, I explored these technologies while making this project.

What I Learned:

HTML for creating the structure of the webpage

CSS for designing and styling the interface

JavaScript for adding functionalities like play, pause, next, and previous songs


My Experience:
While working on this project, I learned a lot and improved my coding skills. I faced challenges but enjoyed solving them. I also took the help of AI tools to clear my doubts and understand tricky parts.

This project marks the beginning of my coding journey, and Iâ€™m excited to learn more and build better projects ahead.
